					<strong style="font-size:110%">Our story <br><br></strong>
					J-P Thompson is a professional Table Football player who created  London Table Football Ltd in 2008  which is now a well-established events and rental company that has built up a strong reputation by hiring, servicing, operating and organizing Foosball competitions in the Capital and around the country.				</p>
